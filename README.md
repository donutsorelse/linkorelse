Link-or-else Game Overview
Link-or-else is a multiplayer Reddit-based game built using Devvit. Players collect words over multiple rounds, form connections between their chosen words, and then vote on each otherâ€™s submitted connections.

Each round has 3 words (by default), and there are 8 rounds total. Each round, a word is displayed, and players can "Claim Word" to add it to their personal collection. If they fail to claim a word by the time the round moves on, the last word of the round is automatically assigned to them.

After all rounds are completed, players move to the Connection phase. Here, they pick at least two of their collected words and describe the connection (a theme, a category, a clever link, etc.).  Each player creates one connection using at least two of their words and submits it.

After all players have submitted their connections (or time runs out), everyone sees all submitted connections. They can upvote or downvote each connection. Upvotes and downvotes affect the final scores.

Once voting is complete (either all players have voted or time runs out), final scores are calculated and displayed. Players see the ranked list of connections.
